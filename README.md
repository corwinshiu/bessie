# bessie
Implementation by Corwin Shiu.

bessie is a circular waveguide mode-matching solver. It's fully implemented in python and is designed to be efficient and easy-to-use. One simply specifies the geometry, frequency, and number of modes and the code will solve for the modal structure, aperture field pattern, and beam pattern of the horn.  

A manuscript documenting the derivation of the equations, and benchmarks speed and accuracy is currently in the works. Will be on arxiv.
